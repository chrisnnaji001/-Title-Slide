        <p>Slide 2: Introduction to SQL</p>
            <p>What is SQL?</p>
            
            <p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language, used to manage and manipulate relational databases.
            It operates with a predefined schema and uses tables to organize data into rows and columns.
            Key Features of SQL:</p>
            
            <p>Relational Structure: Data is stored in tables with defined relationships.</p>
            <p>ACID Compliance: Ensures data reliability through atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.
            SQL Queries: Allows efficient querying, updating, and management of data using structured commands.
            Common SQL Databases:</p>
            
            <p>MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server.
            Use Cases:</p>
            
            <p>Banking systems for financial transactions.
            E-commerce platforms managing customer orders and inventory.
            Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.</p>

        <p>Slide 3: Introduction to MongoDB (NoSQL)
            What is MongoDB?</p>
            
           <P> MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called documents.
            It does not require a predefined schema, making it ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.
            Key Features of MongoDB:</p>
            
            <p>Schema-less Design: Provides flexibility to adapt to changing data requirements.
            Horizontal Scalability: Supports distributed databases through sharding.
            High Performance: Optimized for large-scale, real-time data handling.
            Common Use Cases:</p>
            
            <p>Applications requiring scalability, such as IoT platforms or real-time analytics.
            Content management systems for blogs or multimedia storage.
            Big data applications and social media analytics.

        <p>Slide 4: SQL vs. MongoDB - A Comparison
            Feature	:    SQL (Relational Database):	MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
            Data Model:  Relational (Tables with Rows & Columns):	Document-oriented (JSON-like format)

            Schema:	Fixed Schema:	Schema-less

            Scalability: Vertical (Add more resources to one server):	Horizontal (Add more servers):

            Query Language: 	SQL:	Query API using JSON syntax:

            Transaction Support: Full ACID Compliance:	BASE (Eventual Consistency)

            Performance:	Optimized for complex queries	Optimized for high-speed data storage and retrieval
            Use Case Fit	Structured, transactional data	Flexible or unstructured data
            </p>

                <p>Slide 5: Conclusion
                    Key Takeaways:
                    
                    SQL Databases: Best suited for structured data where relationships between data are crucial. Ideal for applications requiring complex queries and strict consistency, like financial systems.
                    MongoDB: A better fit for applications handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Perfect for use cases needing flexibility and horizontal scalability, such as real-time analytics or IoT systems.
                    The choice between SQL and MongoDB depends on your project requirements, such as data structure, scalability, and performance needs.</p>
